# Leonardo Martins

Backend developer focused on building reliable and scalable APIs.

I work mainly with **Python, Go, FastAPI, PostgreSQL and Docker**, building robust API infrastructures and high-volume data integrations across different platforms.

## About me

I build backend systems that handle real-world data at scale — integrations with third-party APIs, async processing, data ingestion and automation.  
I focus on solutions that are **efficient, maintainable and actually useful for the business** — I care more about clean execution than over-engineered complexity. In short: **I like the simple things that work.**
