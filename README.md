# Leonardo Martins

Backend developer focused on building reliable and scalable APIs.

I work mainly with **Python, Go, FastAPI, PostgreSQL and Docker**, building robust API infrastructures and high-volume data integrations across different platforms.

## About me

I build backend systems that handle real-world data at scale — integrations with third-party APIs, async processing, data ingestion and automation.  
I focus on solutions that are **efficient, maintainable and actually useful for the business** — I care more about clean execution than over-engineered complexity. In short: **I like the simple things that work.**

## My projects:

### CodePlan

CodePlan is a simple AI tool that connects to Jira and Trello, reads your tasks and gives practical guidance on how to approach them. It suggests a possible way to solve each task, points out useful tools or libraries, and gives a realistic time estimate, including a buffer for unexpected issues. It works by consuming data from the Jira and Trello APIs and using ChatGPT to generate objective, context-based insights — useful for both individual developers and teams who want to plan work more efficiently.


### MindFuel
MindFuel is an AI-driven app designed to make learning anything simpler. The idea is to turn any topic someone wants to learn — like “how to program” — into a clear and easy path. The app uses AI to create learning steps, suggest how to include the subject in your daily routine and propose small challenges to track progress, similar to Duolingo. The goal is to make learning any skill feel less overwhelming and more practical.
